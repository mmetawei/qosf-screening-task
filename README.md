Quantum Open Source Foundation Screening Task
I did this task to the best of my knowledge, I tackled Task 2 and Task 3.
Task 2 was easier but I couldn't solve the problem of the flipped phase. Task 2 is incomplete, I tried some phase angles manually but of course it was useless.
For Task 3, I enjoyed how it seemed difficult but it is not and I've been through some papers about Quantum Circuit Synthesis and Optimization.
I came out with some ideas but I am not sure they are relevant here. How deep should we get in the circuit optimization?? This could be a degree thesis not a screening task!
Due to time limit, I am commiting my changes in that state, hoping for the best of Luck for everyone!
